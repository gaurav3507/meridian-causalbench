"""Build the HCP task-decoding triple that parallels CausalBench
(chance / linear / reliability-ceiling). Without this, HCP has only ratios
and cannot share an axis with CausalBench's extraction ceiling
(0.129 / 0.226 / 0.528).

AMENDMENT 2026-07-25 -- the original ceiling arm was mis-specified.
It fit LogReg on train-subject first-halves and scored on held-out
second-halves. That measures within-run temporal repeatability under a
cross-subject decoder, not an achievable upper bound on task classification.
That is why the original 0.1794 landed BELOW linear 0.1798: both used the
same decoder and both differ only in noise. The old ceiling arm is
demoted to `encode_split_nuisance` and reported next to the v2
`encode_over_split` nuisance ratio. The following are added.

  A. `linear_permutation_null` -- shuffle task labels within subject,
     refit the same LogReg 5-fold, >=200 permutations. Real linear must
     clear the null p95.
  B. `variant_within_subject` -- fit LogReg on one encoding (LR) and test
     on the other (RL) within each subject; average across both
     directions. Reports mean +/- SD across subjects and its own
     permutation null. Also reports a MATCHED cross-subject control: the
     cross-subject decoder trained on the same 7-point set (one point per
     task) to hold training-data size constant. Unmatched
     cross-subject = variant_a linear and is reported for reference only.
  C. `variant_within_subject_split_half_ceiling` -- ceiling-B. Same
     LogReg as the within-subject decoder. Per subject: fit on the 14
     A-half (task, encoding) means, score on the 14 B-half means from
     the same runs. Same subject throughout, no cross-subject scoring.
     Bounds within-subject 0.375 itself.
  D. `oracle_ceiling` -- second oracle for the NEW estimator.
     Synthesizes data with KNOWN reliability at three SNR levels (0,
     0.10, 10) and asserts the within-subject split-half estimator
     returns values in the expected bands.

Second amendment 2026-07-25 (later same day):

  * RETIRED the cross-subject nearest-centroid ceiling (0.1869). It did
    not dominate the ridge/logistic decoder it was meant to bound, and
    it was scored cross-subject so it inherited the same between-subject
    penalty as the linear decoder. Any headroom was noise between two
    similarly-limited estimators.
  * The final table now reports TWO ceilings:
      ceiling-A (transfer) = within-subject decoding, LR<->RL encoding
                             split, same subject
      ceiling-B (measurement) = within-subject split-half A->B, LogReg
                                fit and score inside the subject
  * FIXED the within-subject permutation null. Old scheme block-permuted
    all 14 (task, encoding) rows per subject; because each task appears
    twice per subject and the within-subject decoder needs all 7 tasks
    in each encoding, only ~3.7% of block permutations passed and the
    null was estimated on a biased subset. New scheme shuffles labels
    within each (subject, encoding) stratum -- every subject scores on
    every permutation. n_perms raised 100 -> 2000 for tighter p.

`chance` and `linear` (0.1429 and 0.1798) are UNCHANGED. The variant_a
code path that produces them is byte-identical to the pre-amendment
script.

Two variants remain:

(a) HEADLINE -- held-out-subject task decoding.
    chance  = held-out-fold majority-class baseline
    linear  = decoder trained on train-subject first-halves, tested on
              held-out first-halves
    (old `ceiling` retained under variant_a for reproducibility; renamed
    in the output JSON to `encode_split_nuisance` and NOT called ceiling)

(b) SUPPLEMENTARY -- leave-one-task-out shift prediction. UNDERPOWERED.

Inputs and pipeline mirror `hcp/scripts/mean_shift_v2.py` exactly.
Documented in `causalbench/PATHS_hcp.md`.

Guarantees enforced in code:
  - ORACLE #1 (decoder): synthetic-data check that the decoder recovers a
    planted signal at SNR=3. Fails-fast.
  - ORACLE #2 (ceiling): synthetic-data checks at SNR=0 / SNR=2 / SNR=10
    that the split-half classifier returns values within predeclared
    bands. Fails-fast.
  - SAMPLE-SIZE MATCHING: within-subject vs cross-subject decoding is
    reported both matched (=7 training points, one per task) and
    unmatched. Unmatched alone is worthless.
  - MULTIPLE SEEDS: seeds 0-4 wherever a subject split is random.
  - `--clean` removes the specific output JSON before running.
  - Atomic write.

    # subject as one block. Because each task appears exactly twice per
    # subject (once per encoding) and _within_subject_scores requires all K=7
    # tasks to appear in each encoding, only ~3.7% of block permutations were
    # accepted per subject -- the null was estimated on a small biased subset
    # of "lucky" balanced shuffles. That is why 0.375 vs an apparent null of
    # ~0.143 gave p=0.0102 across 644 test points (implausibly weak).
    #
    # New scheme: shuffle task labels INDEPENDENTLY within each (subject,
    # encoding). Each encoding still contains all 7 tasks (in random order),
    # every subject is scored on every permutation, and the null cleanly
    # corresponds to "task labels have no relationship to features".

# ================== LEAKY SAME-RUN SPLIT-HALF (retained for leak diagnostic)
# RETIRED 2026-07-25 as the ceiling-B estimator (was 0.9488). In HCP each
# task is its own run, so within a subject-encoding the task label IS the
# run label. Fitting on A-half and scoring on B-half OF THE SAME RUN means
# the classifier can memorise per-run nuisance (drift, head position,
# baseline gain, subject state) as a perfect label for task. Local
# simulation with per-run baseline_std=3 saturates this estimator at
# accuracy 1.000 EVEN WHEN TASK SNR=0.
#
# The function is retained because `variant_leak_diagnostic` calls it on
# RUN-DEMEANED features (build_projected_halves_run_demeaned): if the
# real-data value collapses toward chance under demeaning, that documents
# the leak for the methods section.
#
# WITHIN-SUBJECT ONLY. No cross-subject scoring appears in this path or its
# oracle. This function fits and scores entirely inside each subject's own
# 14 (task, encoding) rows, using the SAME LogisticRegression as the
# within-subject decoder in variant_within_subject.
#
# Retired 2026-07-25: variant_reliability_ceiling (cross-subject nearest-
# centroid classifier, 0.1869). Retired because (a) nearest-centroid does
# not dominate the ridge/logistic decoder it was meant to bound, and (b) it
# was scored cross-subject, so it inherited the same between-subject
# penalty as the linear decoder it was meant to bound. Any headroom vs
# linear was noise between two similarly-limited estimators.
